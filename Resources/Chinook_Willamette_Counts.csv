The Willamette Falls fish ladder was not operational on the following dates: 8/23/2010-8/27/2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Willamette Falls fishway was shut down for repairs from August 28 - October 5; 2020; which precluded passage above the falls.  The extended fishway closure resulted in delayed migration and large numbers of fish holding below the falls.  No pinniped activity was observed below the falls during this time period and no fish mortality events were reported suggesting the closure did not result in a significant loss in the fish population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
